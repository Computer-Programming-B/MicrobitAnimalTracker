micro:bit Wireless Intruder Alarm
--------------------
In this assignment you will program the micro:bit to create a wireless intruder alarm that will warn you when someone steps on a home-made pressure sensor.

You will need a partner. One person will program their micro:bit to act as the sending device that is triggered by the pressure switch. The other person will program the receiver the activates the alarm. The alarm could use the speaker to create a sound, or you could trigger an LED. In both programs you will need to set the channel to a number from 0 to 83.

Program requirements
-----------------
* Your program must use the micro:bit's radio features
* You will need two micro:bits to complete this project. Find a partner. Each person will submit the Python code for their program (either the sender or receiver) and an animated gif showing the two programs running to Google Classroom

Extensions
----------
If you have extra time, you can add multiple sensors each sending its own message, e.g. ‘room1’, ‘room2’ and have the alarm show where the intruder is. You could also try different designs for the pressure switch. For example, place a foam pad inside it if is being triggered too easily.
You could also make a rain alarm using two tin foil pads very close together – if they get wet, they will trigger the alarm. Be sure not to get your micro:bit wet though! Have fun and be creative, your alarm doesn't have to work like any other.
