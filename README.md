micro:bit Animal Tracker
--------------------
In this assignment you will program the micro:bit's accelerometer and radio features to make a prototype of a device to help scientists track animals like polar bears to discover how they are being affected by climate change.

You will need a partner. One person will program the sending device that would be attached to the animal that was being tracked. The other person will program the receiver collects data about the animals movements. In both programs you will need to set the channel to a number from 0 to 83.

The sending device takes readings from the built-in accelerometer and transmits them by radio. The receiver shows the accelerometer readings on the LED display. Larger numbers mean quicker movements. You can use these numbers to make inferences about an animal's behaviour, for example if it's looking for food, a new habitat or staying in one place to make a home.

Program requirements
-----------------
* Your program must use the micro:bit's sensor and radio features
* Each person will submit the Python code for their program (either the sender or receiver) and an animated gif showing the two programs running to Google Classroom

Extensions
----------
This program measures movement in the Y-axis. The micro:bit's accelerometer can measure forces in other directions, and also give an overall reading of strength. Experiment using different axis measurements to see which works best. Depending on the axis you measure and how you attach the sensor micro:bit, you may notice readings even when the animal is still. This is because of the Earth's gravity, which the micro:bit can also measure! How would you make sure this doesn't affect your readings? What other sensors on the micro:bit could you use to transmit data about an animal?
