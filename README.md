micro:bit Wireless Intruder Alarm
--------------------
In this assignment you will work with a partner to program two micro:bits to create a wireless intruder alarm that will warn you when someone steps on a home-made pressure sensor.

Start by choosing a partner. One person will program their micro:bit to act as the sending device that is triggered by the pressure switch. The other person will program the receiver that activates the alarm. The alarm could use the speaker to create a sound, trigger an LED, or even activate a servo to "whack" the intruder. In both programs you will need to set the group to a number from 0 to 83.

Program requirements
-----------------
* Your program must use the micro:bit's radio features
* Each person will submit the Python code for their program (either the sender or receiver) and an animated gif showing the two programs running to Google Classroom

Suggested steps to completing this assignment
----------
1. Build the sensor. Cut out a small piece of cardoard and fold it in half. Glue two squares of tin foil on one side of the fold, and a third on the other so that when the cardboard is folded the tin foil completes the circuit:

Extensions
----------
If you have extra time, you can add multiple sensors each sending its own message, e.g. ‘room1’, ‘room2’ and have the alarm show where the intruder is. You could also try different designs for the pressure switch. For example, place a foam pad inside it if is being triggered too easily.
You could also make a rain alarm using two tin foil pads very close together – if they get wet, they will trigger the alarm. Be sure not to get your micro:bit wet though! Have fun and be creative, your alarm doesn't have to work like any other.
